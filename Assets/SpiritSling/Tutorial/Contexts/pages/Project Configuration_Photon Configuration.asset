    **Note, this is only required
    to play the app in multiplayer mode.**


    To get the sample working, you will
    need to configure Photon with your own account and applications. The Photon base
    plan is free.


    Visit <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/">photonengine.com</a>
    and create an account

    From your Photon dashboard, click "Create A New App"

    We
    will create a "Fusion" app

    First fill out the form making sure to set type
    to "Photon Fusion". Then click Create.

    Your new app will now show on your
    Photon dashboard. Click the App ID to reveal the full string and copy the value
    for each app.


    Open your unity project and paste your Fusion App ID in <a
    href="./Assets/Photon/Fusion/Resources/PhotonAppSettings.asset">Assets/Photon/Fusion/Resources/PhotonAppSettings</a>.

    The Photon Realtime transport
    should now work. You can check the dashboard in your Photon account to verify
    there is network traffic.

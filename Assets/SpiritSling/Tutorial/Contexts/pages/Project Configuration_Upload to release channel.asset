  m_overrideMarkdownText: '## Upload to release channel

    In order to have colocation
    working using the shared spatial anchors, you will first need to upload an initial
    build to a release channel.

    For instructions you can go to the <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/publish-release-channels-upload/">developer
    center</a>. Then to be able to test with other users you will need to add them
    to the channel, more information in the <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/publish-release-channels-add-users/">Add
    Users to Release Channel</a> topic.


    Once the initial build is uploaded
    you will be able to use any development build with the same application Id, no
    need to upload every build to test local changes.



    ## Headset permissions

    When
    you first launch the application a permission popup will ask to share point cloud,
    you must say yes if you want to use colocation.

    If you answered no, from
    this application or another application using shared point cloud data, you can
    go on device to

    **Settings > Privacy > Device Permissions > Share Point
    Cloud Data**. It must be enabled.


    The application should also have Spatial
    Data permission enabled, this can be verified on device here: **Settings -> Apps
    -> Permissions -> Spatial Data**

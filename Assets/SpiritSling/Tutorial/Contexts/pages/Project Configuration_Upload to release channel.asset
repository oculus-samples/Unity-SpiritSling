  m_overrideMarkdownText: '## Upload to release channel

    In order to have colocation
    working using the shared spatial anchors, you will first need to upload an initial
    build to a release channel.

    For instructions you can go to the <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/publish-release-channels-upload/">developer
    center</a>. Then to be able to test with other users you will need to add them
    to the channel, more information in the <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/resources/publish-release-channels-add-users/">Add
    Users to Release Channel</a> topic.


    Once the initial build is uploaded
    you will be able to use any development build with the same application Id, no
    need to upload every build to test local changes.
